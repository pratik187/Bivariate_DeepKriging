# Bivariate_DeepKriging

## Steps to run the scripts. 

1. Run the file Data_generation.R

2. For simulation results related to Biv.DeepKriging run the scripts inside python_scripts folder. You can choose the simulations specific to Gaussian, non-Gaussian and nonstationary based on the file names.

3. For simulation results related to Parsimonious Matern and LMC check and run the scripts inside R_scripts folder. 

4. For the real data application store the data inside real_data folder and run real_data/R_scripts/reading_ncdf.R

5. For getting the results related to Biv.DeepKriging run the scripts inside real_data/python_scripts/.

6. For getting the results related to CoKriging.Matern run the scripts inside real_data/R_scripts/.
